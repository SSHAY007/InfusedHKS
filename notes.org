#+title: Notes

* GradientTape
This is a level lower than model.fit() while performing backpropagation. Which can be seen [[https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/autodiff][here]].


* TODO
1. Perform DQN on Ant.
2. Perform PPO on Ant.
3. Perform HKS on Ant.
4. Adapt environment

* Polybeast and torchbeats


** TODO : new
1. Perform baseline on Ant using polyhydra then you can add the rest:
   Use the poly hydra libary and build upon that
2. Perform HKS on Ant
3. Make own environment

* Questions
-> What is Policy Approximations, Help understanding page 349
-> Have some questions about IID
-> I have to adapt the polybeast_learner.py to the Ant but I am not sure how to do that. Where do I even start. I am wondering if A3C will work in Mojoco because they do say only Atari things
